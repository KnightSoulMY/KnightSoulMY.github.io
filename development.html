        <h2><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombe">Bombe vs. Enigama [#wiki]</a></h2>
        
        <p>The <b>bombe</b> is an electro-mechanical device used by the British cryptologists to help decipher German Enigma-machine-encrypted secret messages during World War II. The US Navy and US Army later produced their own machines to the same functional specification, albeit engineered differently both from each other and from Polish and British Bombes.</p>
        
        <p>The British bombe was a development from a device that had been designed in Poland at the Biuro Szyfrów (Cipher Bureau) by cryptologist Marian Rejewski, known as the "bomba" (Polish: bomba kryptologiczna) who had been breaking German Enigma messages for the previous seven years using it and earlier machines. The initial design of the British bombe was produced in 1939 at the UK Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS) at Bletchley Park by Alan Turing,[4] with an important refinement devised in 1940 by Gordon Welchman.[5] The engineering design and construction was the work of Harold Keen of the British Tabulating Machine Company. The first bombe, code-named Victory, was installed in March 1940 while the second version, Agnus Dei or Agnes, incorporating Welchman's new design, was working by August 1940.</p>
        
        <p>The <b>Enigma</b> is an electro-mechanical rotor machine used for the encryption and decryption of secret messages. It was developed in Germany in the 1920s. The repeated changes of the electrical pathway from the keyboard to the lampboard implement a polyalphabetic substitution cipher, which turns plaintext into ciphertext and back again. The Enigma's scrambler contains rotors with 26 electrical contacts on each side, whose wiring diverts the current to a different position on the two sides. On depressing a key on the keyboard, an electric current flows through an entry drum at the right-hand end of the scrambler, then through the set of rotors to a reflecting drum (or reflector) which turns it back through the rotors and entry drum, and out to cause one lamp on the lampboard to be illuminated.</p>

        <p>Once the Enigma machine was cracked, 211 Bombe machines were built and ran around the clock. They were stationed at different locations across Britain, in order to reduce the threat of bombings wiping out these highly complex and expensive pieces of kit. Because of a shortage of captured Enigma machines, British cipher machines called Typex were converted into working Enigma machines. Fully deciphered messages were then translated from German to English before being passed on to British intelligence.</p>

        <p>At its peak, the Bombe was able to help crack 3,000 German messages per day. By the end of the war that amounted to 2.5 million messages, many of which gave the Allies vital information about German positions and strategy. It’s estimated that this knowledge played such important roles in key battles that the work of the Bombe and the team at Bletchley Park shortened the war by two years.</p>
