    <h1>Computers Make Life Easier</h1>
    <p1>The society in which we live today has evolved in many ways. One way society has advanced so rapidly over the years is through the use of an amazing electrical device
known as the computer.</p1>
    <br><p2>A computer is a device that has the capability of storing its own memory by operating under the control of instructions. This then enables the computer to accept data,
 which is also known as inputting information. To follow this, the computer then processes specified rules according to the data. The next action the computer takes is to generate results. 
This action is also referred to as output. Lastly, the computer stores the information for use at a later time. This is also known as storage.</p2>
    <br><p3>Today, you can find computers almost anywhere. Some of these locations are to include the home, your place of business, school, local library and area drug store. Some other locations are restaurants, hospitals, doctor's office and dental office to name a few.</p3>
    <br><p4>Within the home, computers can be used to manage bills, shop department or specialty stores, converse with family members and friends far and near via email. You can also play games on it, listen to music, watch movies and students can even do homework assignments on it as well.
In the workplace, computers are used to create and compile invoices and also produce reports. Computers are also used to converse via email by staff members through memos and letters. Some companies have their employees submit their timesheets via the computers.
Some examples of how schools incorporate the use of computers with their students is by having the professor assign their students homework on the internet which is to be completed by a designated deadline.</p4>
